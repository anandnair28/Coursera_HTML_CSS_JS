                <h2>How I Met Your Mother</h2>
                <p>
                    The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor), who narrates the story of how he met the mother of his children. The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with the 
                    27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and 
                    Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders); all of the characters' lives are entwined. 
                    The series explores many storylines, including a "will they or won't they" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, 
                    Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.

                <p>
                    Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and wealthy yet unfulfilling life, and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, 
                    a tightly-wound but caring chef. After Rachel becomes a waitress at West Village coffee house Central Perk, she and Monica become roommates at 
                    Monica's apartment located above Central Perk, and Rachel joins Monica's group of single people in their mid-20s: Previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, 
                    an eccentric, innocent masseuse; neighbor Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, 
                    self-deprecating IT manager; and her older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.

                <h2>Brooklyn Nine Nine</h2>
                <p>
                    Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, 
                    newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt. The detectives include Jake Peralta, who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree 
                    and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago. The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle is partnered 
                    with the apathetic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz. The pair of older detectives, Michael Hitchcock and Norm Scully often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have 
                    solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer.
